# Driving Education App


The Driving Education App is a mobile application designed to provide a user-friendly and customizable learning experience for both learners and drivers. This repository contains the source code and resources for the app, including the user interface, view controllers, Swift code, Firebase Firestore integration, and AWS Lambda functions.

## Features

- Intuitive user interface for learners and drivers.
- Customizable learning goals and progress tracking.
- Personalized feedback and recommendations.
- Secure authentication and user management.
- Real-time data synchronization with Firebase Firestore.
- Integration with AWS Lambda for serverless backend functionality.

## Technologies Used

- Swift: Programming language used for developing iOS apps.
- Xcode: Integrated development environment (IDE) for iOS app development.
- Firebase Firestore: Real-time NoSQL database for data synchronization.
- AWS Lambda: Serverless computing platform for executing backend functions.
- Cocoapods: Dependency manager for incorporating third-party libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode installed on your macOS device.
- Cocoapods installed (`$ gem install cocoapods`).
- Firebase project set up with Firestore enabled.
- AWS account with Lambda function set up.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/driving-education-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `$ cd driving-education-app`
3. Install dependencies using CocoaPods: `$ pod install`
4. Open `DrivingEducationApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
5. Configure Firebase Firestore by adding your project's GoogleService-Info.plist file to the project.
6. Configure AWS Lambda by replacing the placeholder code in `LambdaFunctions.swift` with your own Lambda function code.
7. Build and run the project in the Xcode simulator or on a physical device.

## User Interface & Driver Interface

The user interface and driver interface of the app are designed using Swift code and Xcode's Interface Builder. The user interface provides an intuitive and visually appealing experience for learners, while the driver interface offers the necessary tools and features for driving instructors.

## Design View Controllers

The app utilizes view controllers to manage different screens and functionality. The design of each view controller is implemented using Swift code and Interface Builder in Xcode. These view controllers include:

- LoginViewController: Handles user authentication and login functionality.
- SignupViewController: Manages user registration and account creation.
- LearnerViewController: Provides a customized learning experience for learners.
- DriverViewController: Offers features and tools for driving instructors.
- ProgressViewController: Tracks learner progress and provides feedback.
- SettingsViewController: Allows users to customize their app settings.

## Implementation

The app's functionality is implemented using Swift code, which includes data handling, user interface interactions, and API integrations. The code is organized into logical components and follows best practices for maintainability and readability.

## Firebase Firestore

Firebase Firestore is used for real-time data synchronization and storage. The app integrates with Firestore to store learner progress, user profiles, and other relevant data. Make sure to set up your Firebase project and add the necessary configuration files for Firestore integration.

## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is utilized for serverless backend functionality. The app interacts with AWS Lambda functions for processing data, executing business logic, and integrating with external services. Customize the AWS Lambda functions in `LambdaFunctions.swift` to fit your specific backend requirements.
